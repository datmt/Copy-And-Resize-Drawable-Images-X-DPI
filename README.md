# A Tool to resize and copy image resources x-dpi folders

As a android developer, I usually have to create images and change their size to fit to 
- xxhdpi 
- xhdpi
- hdpi
- mdpi

folders. The task is simple but tedious. This tool is the solution.

Simply select your res folder which contains the above folders and select the images you want to put to those folders. The program will automatically copy your original image to those folders with appropriate size.
